### Calibrarion code
Specifically for piezo stages from Mad City Labs, DAQ systems from National Instruments, and sCOMS cameras from Photometrics.\
V1 : The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera aquires data continuously.\
V2 : The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera take certain frames according to the DAQ boarding triggering.\
V3 : The piezo stage stops at each Z position, and the camera take certain frames according to the DAQ boarding triggering.
A csv file is generated and saved for EasyDHPSF calibrations.
